                        similar damages, whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
                        otherwise, arising from your use of any of the service or any products procured using the
                        service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of the service or any product,

                        quality products. All orders made through our online store are considered custom orders, made as

                        your mind about a particular purchase. Each piece of jewelry can take several days to several
                        weeks to create from start to finish. However, some articles may be accepted for partial store
                        credit or exchange, at the sole discretion of Frosted Gold Jewellery, if returned in salable

                        restocking fees and/or reconditioning fees. All shipping fees are non-refundable unless you
                        received damaged, defective, or wrong item(s). Returns must be unworn, unaltered, come in
                        original package, and must be approved.</p>

                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect
                        the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. When you
                        browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer&rsquo;s internet protocol (IP)
                        address in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and
                        operating system. Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails
                        about our store, new products and other updates.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h3>
                    <p>How do you get my consent? When you provide us with personal information to complete a
                        transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a
                        purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason
                        only. If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will
                        either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say
                        no.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p>How do I withdraw my consent? If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your
                        consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your
                        information, at anytime, by contacting us at info@goldteethcanada.com or mailing us at: Gold
                        Teeth Canada #305, 9664-106 Avenue NW , Edmonton, AB, Canada, T5H 0N4, Canada</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h3>
                    <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate
                        our Terms of Service.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h3>
                    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                        information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
                        transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                        required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we
                        recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your
                        personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain
                        providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than
                        either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a
                        third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
                        jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if
                        you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the
                        United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject
                        to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our
                        store&rsquo;s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
                        longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website&rsquo;s Terms of Service.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p><strong>Links</strong><br />When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from
                        our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to
                        read their privacy statements.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <h3>SECTION 5 - SECURITY</h3>

                    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
                    <h3>Shipping Rates and Times</h3>
                    <p>Shipping rates vary depending on region and are calculated when your shipping information is
                        entered during the checkout process. Most orders ship within 1-2 business days from the time of
                        the order is placed. Please note that transit times for the delivery method you select do not
                        include order processing time.<br /><br /></p>
                    <h3>Inventory Level, Back Orders, and Pre-order Items</h3>
                    <p>Inventory Levels: Our website offers sizes, styles, and designs based on inventory available in
                        all our warehouses combined. Therefore, there is the possibility that an item you purchase may
                        not be available to ship to you. You will be contacted in 1-2 business days if you need to make
                        a substitution on an unavailable item.<br /><br />Backorders: Most items available for purchase
                        online will be in stock, however, due to fluctuations in Internet sales, and variations in our
                        various warehouse inventories certain items may not be available. If your order contains an item
                        that is on backorder, your order will not ship until the item is in stock. The amount of time
                        for out of stock products to be replenished at our warehouses ranges from 1-2 weeks, but it may
                        take longer depending on manufacturing schedules. Please contact us PRIOR to placing your order
                        if you would like to know if the items you would like to buy are in stock. You will be charged
                        for your ENTIRE order at the time of purchase.<br /><br />Pre-order items: Product listed as a

                        complete.<br /><br /></p>
